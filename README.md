## Brief description
A simple graphical tool for simulating the signal behaviour from spoiled gradient 
echo and balanced steady state acquisitions as used in the quantitative mcDESPOT
protocol.

## How to use
1. Start the GUI by typing
```
mcDESPOT_simulation
```
2. Set/choose the tissue types to plot in "Relaxation Values"
3. Set/choose the acquisition parameters for SPGR and bSSFP
